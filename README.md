# PyBer-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show the total number of rides, drivers, and fares per city as well as the average fares per ride and driver. 

## Results
Urban cities have the highest ride count and double the drivers, which causes them to have the lowest average fare per driver. Rural city rides cost the most because there are significantly less drivers to provide services and the distances are probably longer.

## Summary
I would recommend attempting to increase the drivers in rural areas in order to decrease the average fare per ride. Instead of incentivizing new drivers to start in new cities, we could redeploy the drivers from urban areas to decrease the oversaturated driver pool. Suburban areas see to have a steady income per ride and per driver but the rides barely surpass the drivers, I would suggest expanding to more suburban areas in order to keep a steady income for future growth.
